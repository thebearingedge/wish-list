# wish-list

- ssr
- hmr
- tsx
- esm
- req -> res
- web apis
- server-side routing
- client-side routing
- fast enough
- small enough
- easy to test
- foss (duh)

# non-priorities

- ssg
- isr
- serverless / edge (how is this hard anyway ðŸ¤”, don't you just need an adapter?)
- arbitrary front end framework (preact is all you really need)
- islands "architecture"
